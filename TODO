[ ] add command to set logMinDurationQuery (ms) via update_configuration m2ee api
[ ] possibility to use units (ms,s,h,d,w,y) for time length values
[ ] add command to display cache_statistics
[ ] man m2ee.yaml instead of lots of documentation in the example file itself
[ ] allow scheduled event names to be specified by a yaml list instead of comma separated string
[ ] implement munin/nagios plugins by importing m2ee instead of abusing the CLI tool
[ ] when choosing abort after errors (e.g. ddl commands, invalid database host, mf constants) completely shutdown runtime again, instead of leaving it at the stage it was during startup. this behaviour is more intuitive.
[ ] somehow remember the name of the last unpacked .mda file (see mendix support #14621)
[ ] don't even try to load config.json when in A/P mode
[ ] check DTAPMode case insensitive
[ ] remove all left-overs of user interaction from lib files (raw_input etc)
