m2ee-tools 0.5.7, 27 Nov 2013

m2ee now has the possibility to download missing Mendix Runtime distributions on
demand.

In order to use this functionality, the mxjar_repo configuration setting (in the
mxnode section of the yaml configuration file) needs to have a user writable
location included. If a 'runtimes' directory exists under the app_base location,
as specified in the m2ee section below, it will be inserted at the front of the
mxjar_repo automatically, to facilitate runtime downloads on demand.

The new download_runtime command can be used without any argument, in which case
it will try downloading the Mendix Runtime for the current unpacked application
model, if it's missing.

When providing an argument to download_runtime, e.g. "download_runtime 4.7.1",
another Mendix Runtime can be downloaded. When preparing for a new application
release, this can be used to make sure the new version is already installed.

Also, see the documentation in examples/full-documented-m2ee.yaml about
configuring mxjar_repo
