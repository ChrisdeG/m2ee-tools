m2ee-tools 0.5.11~pre1, 30 Dec 2014
===================================

The source of the munin plugin for m2ee and all documentation are now also
included in the m2ee source tree.

A new graph, a JVM Process Memory breakdown is included in the munin plugin.
Unfortunately, to be able to use this graph munin needs to be patched to set
group permissions correctly. See the munin page in the documentation for more
information about this.

m2ee-tools 0.5.9, 14 Apr 2014
=============================

The new -y (or --yolo) argument to m2ee can be used to suppress questions that
ask for confirmation when using commands like stop, unpack, emptydb and
restoredb. During start, activating yolo mode will even automatically execute
and save DDL commands, and change passwords of admin users to some random
password if the runtime refuses to start because they have password '1'.

This option can be used for quick and dirty automation of application
deployment using one-off m2ee commands, or it can be used when you're working in
some test or development environment where you don't need to be cautious at all
about throwing away data etc.

m2ee-tools 0.5.7, 27 Nov 2013
=============================

m2ee now has the possibility to download missing Mendix Runtime distributions on
demand.

In order to use this functionality, the mxjar_repo configuration setting (in the
mxnode section of the yaml configuration file) needs to have a user writable
location included. If a 'runtimes' directory exists under the app_base location,
as specified in the m2ee section below, it will be inserted at the front of the
mxjar_repo automatically, to facilitate runtime downloads on demand.

The new download_runtime command can be used without any argument, in which case
it will try downloading the Mendix Runtime for the current unpacked application
model, if it's missing.

When providing an argument to download_runtime, e.g. "download_runtime 4.7.1",
another Mendix Runtime can be downloaded. When preparing for a new application
release, this can be used to make sure the new version is already installed.

Also, see the documentation in examples/full-documented-m2ee.yaml about
configuring mxjar_repo
